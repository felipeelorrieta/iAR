    abstract = "{Time series observations are ubiquitous in astronomy and are generated, for example, to distinguish between different types of supernovae to detect and characterize extrasolar planets and to classify variable stars. These time series are usually modelled using a parametric and/or physical model that assumes independent and homoscedastic errors, but in many cases, these assumptions are not accurate and there remains a temporal dependence structure on the errors. This can occur, for example, when the proposed model cannot explain all the variability of the data or when the parameters of the model are not properly estimated. In this work, we define an autoregressive model for irregular discrete-time series based on the discrete time representation of the continuous autoregressive model of order 1. We show that the model is ergodic and stationary. We further propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure and assess the finite sample performance by Monte Carlo simulations. We implement the model on real and simulated data from Gaussian as well as other distributions, showing that the model can flexibly adapt to different data distributions. We apply the irregular autoregressive model to the residuals of a transit of an extrasolar planet to illustrate errors that remain with temporal structure. We also apply this model to residuals of an harmonic fit of light curves from variable stars to illustrate how the model can be used to detect incorrect parameter estimation.}",

    title = "{Long-term monitoring of the archetype Seyfert galaxy MCG-6-30-15: X-ray, optical and near-IR variability of the corona, disc and torus}",

    abstract = "{We present long-term monitoring of MCG-6-30-15 in X-rays, optical and near-IR wavelengths, collected over 5 yr of monitoring. We determine the power spectrum density of all the observed bands and show that after taking into account the host contamination similar power is observed in the optical and near-IR bands. There is evidence for a correlation between the light curves of the X-ray photon flux and the optical B band, but it is not possible to determine a lag with certainty, with the most likely value being around 0 d. Strong correlation is seen between the optical and near-IR bands. Cross-correlation analysis shows some complex probability distributions and lags that range from 10 to 20 d, with the near-IR following the optical variations. Filtering the light curves in frequency space shows that the strongest correlations are those corresponding to the shortest time-scales. We discuss the nature of the X-ray variability and conclude that this is intrinsic and cannot be accounted for by absorption episodes due to material intervening in the line of sight. It is also found that the lags agree with the relation τ ∝ λ4/3, as expected for an optically thick geometrically thin accretion disc, although for a larger disc than that predicted by the estimated black hole mass and accretion rate in MCG-6-30-15. The cross-correlation analysis suggests that the torus is located at ∼20 light-days from the central source and at most at ∼50 light-days from the central region. This implies an active galactic nucleus bolometric luminosity of ∼3 × 1043 erg s−1 cm−2.}",
